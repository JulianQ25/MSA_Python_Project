    "#### INPUT:      \n",
    "                   Reads Score.txt file that converts the file \n",
    "                   into a readable list.\n",
    "#### PROCESS:    \n",
    "                   Create functions for to help find\n",
    "                   number of scores, mean, std. deviation,\n",
    "                   lowest score, highest score and calculate grade curve.\n",
    "                   Create a dictionary to display list of grades (A:.B:,C:,D:,F:)\n",
    "                   with the count for each grade.\n",
    "#### OUTPUT:     \n",
    "                   The program that will display the total\n",
    "                   count of scores, average, std. dev,\n",
    "                   max score and min score. As well as\n",
